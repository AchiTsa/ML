# What do you want to achieve?
    I want to analyse the Speed Dating Data set for interesting Clusters and Facts.

# How you try to achieve possible solution to your problem?

    # Cluster Method
        Since I have high-dimensional data to deal with the K-means++ cluster seems most suitable.
        The Elbow Method shows interesting behaviour at 3, 5, 6 and 7 clusters 

        # General Information
            Wcss at 2, 5 and 6 visible.

        # Hobbies
            WCSS at 2,3 and 6 visible.

        # Personal Information
            WCSS at 2,3 and 5 visible.

# What "evidence" do you need to validate your solution?
    In general an overview of the data without clustering and preprocessing is always interesting.ä
    Since we are focused on dating there are a lot of categories to be considered.



# Have you solved your problem? If yes then what is the solution. If no then why you most likely have not solved your problem.
    The problem or lets say the knowledge to gain out of this data set is a hugh one and of course there are just some things i could learn in this short period of time.
    
        # Interestingly there is a big difference in what the two genders personally are looking for when it comes to a partner.
        
        # Also when it comes to activities there is a big difference in both genders.
        
        # Also cluster gave interesting information
            - For example there is a connection between age and race
            - There are many other things that can be especially read out of the pairplot<XXX>.png charts



# !!!Note!!!
To not run in to problems with the gitlab tester (time out) I sample the data really hard. But the real data charts are anyway available in the results folder at the different folders for the different data!
